The design for LD-in-Couch has been influenced and inspired by Ilya Katsov's [NoSQL Data Modeling Techniques](http://highlyscalable.wordpress.com/2012/03/01/nosql-data-modeling-techniques/) as well as the wonderful book [Seven Databases in Seven Weeks: A Guide to Modern Databases and the NoSQL Movement](http://pragprog.com/book/rwdata/seven-databases-in-seven-weeks) written by Eric Redmond and Jim R. Wilson.
